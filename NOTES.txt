Developer Experience
----------------------
Feels similar to this in .NET 6:
- dotnet new webapp -o mytestapp

Our sample also explains things in a consumer focused way
Customers struggle a lot with the cookies, so make that the main focus.

Cookies
-------
These have some special rules with localhost
Use proper URLs so that readers understand the architecture:
- www.example.com
- login.example.com

Deals properly with cookies - bad defaults use SameSite=None and require SSL
Try to use SameSite=strict and support both.

Configuration
-------------
I'd like to demonstrate three options via the config file:
- Local with only HTTP
- Local with HTTPS - use openssl rather than rubbish MS test certificates
- Different external SSL, perhaps via NGINX routing to HTTP inside the cluster

Error Handling
---------------
No developer hacks or rubbish MS defaults, such as a developer exception page
Do this to a good level and have an error view to render OAuth and cookie errors

Web Design
----------
Use cshtml as little as possible and prefer plain HTML
Stub javascript and css files with not much in them
Protected Page to have a logout button

Reverse Proxy
-------------
I would like to get this basically working also, and demonstrate how to handle
